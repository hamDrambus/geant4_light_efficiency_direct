//TODO: this class is becoming too complex and complicated thus is should be split
//Current mandates:
//	0) photon with statistical weights (probabilities) managment
//	1) Setting particle gun parameter accordingly to simulatoion state (MC's nodes managment)
//	2) Storing current simulation state (curr_photon_event, curr probability and so on)
//	3) Interface for modifying sim. state and updating current state accordingly
//	4) Storing mapping state and transitional functiion for work with it (being called from process,
//	call detector construction's methods)
//	5) Analisis of simulation
//	6) Supress growths of secondary photons (number of combinations) - this option is shared with detector construction
// issue: fuctions for primary simulation MC node are somewhat duplicated from MC_node class
// Also managing of MC node be better be reworked with proper interface

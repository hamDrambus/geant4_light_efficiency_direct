#define FIX_TRANSMITTANCE_
//^if defined, then transmittance spectras are normalized to their top plateau
//this is correct, because the deviation of the plateau from unity is caused by refractive index,
//not absorbtion. Since n is used separeately transmittance spectras must be adjusted. They were
//obtained experimentally, with several boundary processes. Adding the calculated from n reflectance
//wouldn't be right, because if there is no transmittance there would be several boundary proceses and 
//hence higher R. The validity of n can be checked from R at zero transmittance (which means light comes throgh one boundary
//to the WLS and gets absorbed there), when it can be calculated by fresnel law.
//\/DONE: T in such configuration (wls+acrylic, ideal PMT, 2.9eV gamma, only Fresnel) is 0.91132 (direct 
//\/MC simulation), which is quite close to 0.8967, so the precedure above is valid
//DONE: TODO: check renormalization by plateau with R calclated for wls-acrilyc plate (as in source of data)
//TODO: ideally transmittance adjustment should be done by simulating T without absorbtion in the same configuration
//by refractive indices, but I think that would be an overkill
